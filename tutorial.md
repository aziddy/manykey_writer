# ManyKey Writer
You're now ready to connect your new keyboard to your computer and program some useful functionality onto it!

If you haven't already, download the ManyKey Writer software <a href="https://github.com/epbarger/manykey_writer/releases">here</a>. Unzip the archive and run the app (macOS) or exe (Windows). Once the software is running, connect your new keyboard to a USB port on your computer. If you're on Windows, a driver dialog may pop up - let it do its thing.

Once you're ready, click the "Refresh Devices" button to populate the dropdown. In the dropdown, select your device - it is very likely to be identified as "Arduino Leonardo". If you do not see anything that looks like your device, try reconnecting your keyboard and restarting ManyKey Writer.

If everything has gone correctly, ManyKey writer will have loaded the current key configuration off your keyboard automatically, and should look like the screenshot below.
